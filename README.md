### Big Data Technologies CIS-4130
I built a complete machine learning pipeline that incorporates big data technologies using AWS cloud infrastructure. I used the Amazon US Customer Reviews Dataset. The Amazon US Customer Reviews Dataset contains millions of Amazon customers have contributed over a hundred million reviews to express opinions and describe their experiences regarding products on the Amazon.com website. In this project, I used some ML techniques to better understand customer sentiment towards the products.
